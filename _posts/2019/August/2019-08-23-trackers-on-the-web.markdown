This is an interesting article I read today. This opinion piece on the NY Times - facilitated by The Times's Privacy Project reports the following,

>**News sites were the worst**
>
>Among all the sites I visited, news sites, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, had the most tracking resources. This is partly because the sites serve more ads, which load more resources and additional trackers. But news sites often engage in more tracking than other industries, according to a study from Princeton.

Oh how ironic.

PS: I really like the visualisations.
