I've been using a previous generation Macbook Air (pre-redesign) for years now. It's a "travel laptop" - I don't need it to be powerful. My main computer is a PC that I built 2 years ago that is plenty powerful.

For travel, I need my laptop to,
* be Light, and fairly portable.
* have a decently long battery life.
* have good interfaces, keyboard and touchpad.
* have a robust charging system (something that I have grown to love after using Magsafe)

The new Macbooks meet only the first two, and completely fail at the other two. As such, I have been putting off upgrading my laptop for years now. (Also, since I don't need more power in my laptop - I don't feel that an upgrade is necessary at this point)

Recently I had a chance to use a Surface Laptop. It was a brilliant experience. Apart from a couple of flaws, I think its a far superior replacement for my Macbook than any current-gen Macbook. The Surface Connector mechanism is great (Apple seems to have forgotten that magnetic charging cables are a great idea), the keyboard is great (better than butterfly switches on the new Macbooks) and the screen is lovely (3:2 aspect ratio is a great idea). The only things I dislike about it were, the ports (single USB-A and a Display Port) and the Alcantara material. Both of which are fixed in the new generation Surface Laptop - which has a Type-C port instead of a Display Port and an optional aluminium finish.

It seems like the ideal upgrade for me.
