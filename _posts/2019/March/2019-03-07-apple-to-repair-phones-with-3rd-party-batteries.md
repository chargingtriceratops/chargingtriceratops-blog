I think this is long overdue. As someone who uses Apple products on a daily basis, I've always disliked its repair and service policies.

For too often Apple needlessly lets gadgets go to waste when it is fully possible to repair them. Far too often Apple just junks entire logic boards or even entire devices for something that could be fixed with a minor component fix.

This is a step in the right direction I suppose.
