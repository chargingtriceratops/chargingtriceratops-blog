Just read this bit of ridiculousness,
"[JavaScript infinite alert prank lands 13-year-old Japanese girl in hot water](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/japanese-police-charge-13-year-old-girl-for-infinite-javascript-popup-prank/)".

Japanese police must be really bored if they're going around arresting kids for what is essentially just an infinite loop.
