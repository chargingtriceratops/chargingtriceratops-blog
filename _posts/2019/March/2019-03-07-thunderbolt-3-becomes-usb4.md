What on earth is going on with the USB spec? It was bad enough with USB 3.1 Gen1 Gen2, Thunderbolt 3 and now this.

[USB 3.2 Gen 2x2, I mean what is that?](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/usb-3-2-is-going-to-make-the-current-usb-branding-even-worse/)

Thunderbolt 3 is really great, but the fact that most USB-C cables don't support it has limited its usage. I just hope USB4 won't be such a mess with USB4 Gen 1 or Gen 1x1 or whatever the hell is going on with USB 3.2.
