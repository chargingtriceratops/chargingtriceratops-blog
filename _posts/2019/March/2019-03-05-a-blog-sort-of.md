title: A blog. Sort of.

Over the past couple of years, I've felt a growing discontent with social media. As such I've started deleting my accounts on multiple sites. I've grown to prefer pseudo-anonymous identities - like on HN or Reddit where a username exists to maintain history. I've wiped out most of my social media presence. Leaving this and Twitter (@chartriceratops).

I've created this simple site for me to put longer posts on. Not a blog per se, but just an open place for me to dump my thoughts.

This site is based on the [Jekyll Now setup](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
