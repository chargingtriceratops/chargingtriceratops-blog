## What is this site?

This is a site for me to dump my thoughts. This is a place for me to share posts that I find interesting.

And if I ever write anything interesting - to share that as well.

It's a mix of a public notebook, a journal and a blog. 

I'm not really writing on this site with anything in mind. Just anything that I don't necessarily want on my IRL identity - nothing malicious, but I like to maintain a gap between the two identities. See [Context Collapse](https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2013/12/08/coining-context-collapse.html).

I'm never really sure about the political alignment of people around me - I'm not very good at judging that. hence I avoid talking about that IRL - but this identity, I've tried to separate as much as possible from my real life.
