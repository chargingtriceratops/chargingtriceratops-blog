This is a pseudo-anonymous blog, to act as a replacement for my social media.

Instead of shouting into the void on a platform that spies on me, I am choosing to shout into the void of the internet via this site.

This is also a place for me to keep interesting things I find.

I have a minimal presence on Twitter [@chartriceratops](https://twitter.com/chartriceratops). 

I'm more active on Reddit [u/chargingtriceratops](https://old.reddit.com/user/chargingtriceratops).

Email me at contact[at][site].

**Update:** *December 2019*

You can also find me on [keybase under ctriceratops](https://keybase.io/ctriceratops).

I'm now on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@chargingtriceratops">Mastodon</a> as well.
